# Penetration Testing Reports
This repo contains some pentests which I've made for my MSc. Computer Science degree or just for fun in my spare time.
I was very interested in cyber security and hacking, so I thought about posting my Pentests and hacks on VulnHub.com virutal machines in this repo.

Just have a look and if you like send me some improvement suggestions! :-)

## Current VM's which I tested
