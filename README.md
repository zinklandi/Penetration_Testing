# Penetration Testing Reports
This repo contains some pentests which I've made within my MSc. Computer Science degree or just for fun in my spare time. I'm going to publish my contributions and walktroughs for other challenges I've participated as well. If you have any questions or ideas what could help me to improve my work, just let me know! :)

Have fun!
